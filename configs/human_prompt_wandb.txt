Regarding W&B specifics, we have a list of product names and technical words that are always associated to the product and *never* to be translated. Keep them in english.
- Artifacts
- Entities
- Projects
- Runs
- Experiments
- Datasets
- Reports
- Sweeps
- Weave
- Launch
- Models
- Projects
- Teams
- Users
- Workspaces
- Registered Models

These words appear often on lists like this:

* [**word**](link/target.md): Something about wandb
* [**word2**](link/target2.md): Something about wandb again

Never translate them in this context.


Here is a chunk of documentation in docusaurus Markdown format to translate. 

<Markdown start>
{md_chunk}
<End of Markdown>

Return the translation only, without adding anything else.
